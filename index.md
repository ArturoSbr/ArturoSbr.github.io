# Welcome!

My name is Arturo and I am a highly-caffeinated Data Scientist with a BSc in
Economics, an MSc in Applied Economics and over eight years of experience in the
field.

I work as a Data Scientist at [BBVA](https://www.bbva.com/), where I use:
1. Artifficial Intelligence to develop predictive models; and
2. Statistical Analysis to quantify cause-effect relationships.


## Recent Work

I recently developed a PySpark implementation of the [
    Louvain algorithm for community detection
](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476). This project led me to make a few
contributions to [NetworkX](
    https://github.com/networkx
), [GraphFrames](
    https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html
) and [mercury](
    https://www.bbvaaifactory.com/mercury/
) (BBVA's open-source library). More generally, my recent work has focused on
using Machine Learning and Graph Theory to detect money laundering schemes.


## Side Quests

I am currently writing [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Statistical Learning](
    https://arturosbr.github.io/islp/00-index.html
) in my spare time. This guide is essentially a summarized version of [
    An Introduction to Statistical Learning
](https://www.statlearning.com) which may help you sharpen your skills as a Data
Scientist.
