# Welcome!

My name is Arturo and I am a highly-caffeinated Data Scientist with a BSc in
Economics, an MSc in Applied Economics and over eight years of experience in the
field.

## What I do

As a Data Scientist, I use data to:
1. Make predictions, and
2. Quantify cause-effect relationships.

In the past, I have developed predictive tools to forecast all sorts of
stuff. As an example of my work as a Data Scientist, you can [click here](

) to send requests to a credit score I published a few years ago.

## What I'm working on right now

I am currently developing a PySpark implementation of the [
    Louvain algorithm for community detection
](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476) for [@BBVA](https://www.bbva.com/). I had
never worked with Graphs prior to this, but developing this algorithm has
quickly made Graph Theory one of my favorite fields of study. In fact, I have
made a few contributions to [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx) and
[GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html)
as part of this project!

Hopefully, I'll be able to publish the algorithm as part of [mercury](
    https://www.bbvaaifactory.com/mercury/
), (BBVA's open-source library).
